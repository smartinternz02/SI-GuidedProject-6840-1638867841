1. What is 7 to the power of 4?

2.  Split this string into a list. 
    s = "Hi there Sam!"

3.Given the variables
    planet = "Earth"
    diameter = 12742
Use .format() to print the following string
The diameter of Earth is 12742 kilometers.

4.Given this nested list, use indexing to grab the word "hello
    lst = [1,2,[3,4],[5,[100,200,['hello']],23,11],1,7]

5. Given this nested dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky
    d = {'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}

6.What is the main difference between a tuple and a list?

7.Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form : user@domain.com
    So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com

8. Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string. 
    Don't worry about edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do account for capitalization.

9. Use lambda expressions and the filter() function to filter out words from a list that don't start with the letter 's'.
    For example:
    seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
    should be filtered down to:    ['soup','salad']

10. You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function
      to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". 
      If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 
      and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big    Ticket".
     Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) --
     on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
